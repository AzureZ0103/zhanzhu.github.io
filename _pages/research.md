#### [**Ekici's Reclaim-proof Allocations Revisited**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4983814), Qianfeng Tang and **Zhan Zhu**, 2024

This paper revisits the concept of reclaim-proof allocations proposed by Ekici (2013) for house allocation problems with existing tenants and proposes a new notion of core called the effectual core by restoring the feasibility of coalitional blocking in Ekiciâ€™s definition. The main result shows that the effectual core, while by definition weaker than reclaim-proofness, is actually equivalent to it. An allocation is in the effectual core if and only if it is produced by the You request my house-I get your turn (YRMH-IGYT) mechanism (Abdulkadirouglu and Sonmez, 1999) and if and only if it is a competitive allocation.
